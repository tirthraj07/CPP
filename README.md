## C++ Tutorial

This repository serves as a mirror of all my files from [REPLIT](https://replit.com/). Due to recent changes in the platformâ€™s policies, Iâ€™ve decided to back up everything on GitHub.

This repository is especially close to my heart, as it contains all the code Iâ€™ve written since I first began learning C++. The journey began with my very first tutorial, **`Ls 01: Understanding a Simple C++ Program`**, created on **June 6, 2020**, when I entered 11th grade and started learning C++ as part of my Computer Science (Bifocal) subject.

Although I had dabbled in Python since 8th grade â€” learning core fundamentals and building small projects using `tkinter` â€” C++ was the first language that truly captivated me and sparked my passion for programming. As a result, this repository stands as a meaningful reminder of where it all began.

### Whatâ€™s Inside

This repository covers a wide range of C++ topics, including:

- Basics of C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) â€“ Basics and Advanced
- Templates in C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
- Advanced C++ Concepts
- Memory Alignment and Padding

This repository closely follows the exact learning path I took when I started programming. Most files include references at the top, and some are accompanied by my personal notes. Feel free to explore and learn from them.

Thank you for checking it out! ðŸ˜Š
